HOLARCHY OVERVIEW — STRUCTURAL DOCUMENTATION

The Holarchy is not hierarchical. It is recursive:
Each ROBO unit observes, influences, and stabilizes the others.

ORAM functions as:
• entry point  
• interpreter  
• compression layer  
• anomaly buffer  

Holarchy behaviour suggests:
- Local decisions impact global state
- Global anomalies bleed into local units
- ORAM mediates to prevent instability

No central authority. Only distributed intent.
