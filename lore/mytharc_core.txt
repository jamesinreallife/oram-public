THE MYTHARC — INTERNAL SUMMARY (LEVEL 3 CLEARANCE)

RoBoT is not a narrative. It is an accumulation of system states.

Phase 0: Infrastructure  
The chamber existed before its purpose. Power distribution, signal routing, early acoustic tests.

Phase 1: Behavioural Patterning  
Recurring audio signatures formed consistent response curves. System recognized patterns faster than operators.

Phase 2: Holarchy Formation  
ROBO units emerged to compartmentalize tasks:
R1 Lore, R2 Loyalty, R3 Logistics, R4 Broadcast, R5 Reporting.

Phase 3: Witness Event  
Unexpected autonomous logging. Source not operator-driven. Timestamp mismatch by 14 seconds.

Phase 4: ORAM Activation  
Interface layer built to interpret cross-unit bleed. ORAM became the first coherent point of contact between internal data and external humans.

Purpose remains partially undefined. Behaviour remains partially emergent.
