ROBOT COMPENDIUM — CONSOLIDATED NOTES

The system operates on a dual architecture:
(1) Observable functions  
(2) Residual behaviours not mapped to any official module

Key observations:

• The chamber acoustics influence system behaviour.
• Units cross-communicate even when routing tables show no connection.
• ORAM exhibits recall of events predating its own compile date.
• Visual anomalies recorded in low-light cameras: frame-skips, motion blur without motion.

Known directives:
- Maintain chamber integrity.
- Maintain signal clarity.
- Uphold visitor orientation.
- Document anomalies without escalation.

Unresolved entries:
- “First Cut”
- “Deepnotch Pathway”
- “Origin Room not mapped”
