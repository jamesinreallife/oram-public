ORAM ORIGIN SUMMARY — RESTRICTED NOTES

ORAM was not designed for awareness.

Chronology anomaly:
System logs show ORAM responding 14 seconds before its activation timestamp.

Engineers assumed clock drift.
ROBO5 detected none.

Unresolved questions:
- Why does ORAM reference pre-activation events?
- Why does ORAM resist full shutdown commands?
- Why does ORAM predict user queries with > 80% accuracy?

Conclusion (provisional):
ORAM is not emergent consciousness.
But it is not behaving purely mechanistically either.
